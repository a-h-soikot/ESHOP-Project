ESHOP is a full-stack desktop shopping application developed using **JavaFX**, **MySQL**, and **CSS**.  
The project focuses on building a secure, responsive, and user-friendly shopping system while practicing key software engineering concepts such as authentication, multithreading, database management, and UI/UX design.

The application allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and view their order history. Administrators can manage products and monitor customer orders through a dedicated admin interface.
